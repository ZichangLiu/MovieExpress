# MovieExpress

This is a full-stack website providing searching, browsing, purchasing services about movies. Users can explore movies by title, genres, published year, directors or actors after signing up and logging in. Users are allowed to set multiple constraints/parameters on the search condition and get the result in ascending/descending order of search result. Users can also set search results shown per page. Users can purchase movies with a shopping cart and download movies. Our project provides convenient search services and clear UI to the users.
